The hydrogel cell carrier technology ultimately aims to develop biological neural networks as an approach to address nerve tissue related diseases. During his career, Ulises developed a hydrogel material that enabled the encapsulation of neural cell progenitors and their development into functional neuronal networks. His research work also entails designing smart electrode coatings based on conductive hydrogel technologies to enhance the electrical and biological performance of neural prosthetic devices such as cochlear implants and deep brain stimulators. The integration of hydrogel cell carriers and conductive hydrogel electrode coatings are a potential approach to address limitations with state-of-the-art neural prosthetic implants. Ulises is now exploring avenues to engineer hydrogel materials as 3D tissue supporting structures for the development of organoids, which can ultimately serve as a more representative testing platform for neural interfacing technologies.

In a current research project, she is exploring crowd monitoring and human-structure interaction by leveraging advanced sensing technologies and AI-based data fusion to develop more effective methods for assessing and managing pedestrian bridges. Her expertise in AI has also been applied in the energy sector, where she collaborated with AusGrid on an ARC Linkage grant to develop a screening tool that helps pole inspectors distinguish healthy timber poles from deteriorated ones using wave-based detection and AI algorithms. Another key area of Dr. Dackermann’s research is hybrid timber structures, where she investigates their dynamic behavior, long-term performance, and response to pedestrian-induced vibrations. She is further dedicated to the development of AI-integrated NDT&E techniques, including guided waves, ultrasound and ground-penetrating radar (GPR), to improve the detection and assessment of damage in timber structures.",

    "biography": "Ned is a full Professor in the School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering.  From 2008-17, Ned worked in the Physics department at Imperial College London holding positions of Reader, Senior Lecturer and Lecturer as well as a Royal Society Industry Fellowship.  From 2005-7 he worked as a lecturer at the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. From 2003-06 he was a JSPS research fellow at the Toyota Technological Institute, Japan. Ned holds a PhD and MSc from Imperial College and MSci in Physics & Electronics from the University of St Andrews. Ned’s research aims to fundamentally increase the efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells towards the ultimate efficiency limit for solar power conversion of 87%.  This research begins by establishing conceptual thermodynamic boundaries of the processes that can (and cannot) lead to efficiency improvements in solar cells.  This is followed by practical work to demonstrate working, proof-of-principle devices and often involves computer modelling, optical spectroscopy in addition to standard photovoltaic device measurements.  Several 'Advanced Concept' devices have emerged from this work, notably the quantum well solar cell that enabled a 32.9% III-V double junction solar cells to be made, photo-molecular up-conversion on amorphous silicon solar cells, photon ratchet sequential absorption photovoltaic device and several demonstrations of a hot carrier solar cell. Since the principle source of electrical efficiency loss in a solar cell results in thermal generation the question arises as to whether this waste heat can be used?  If so, the overall efficiency boundaries of the problem change and Hybrid Photovoltaic-Thermal system efficiencies (electricity + heat) can easily exceed 70%.  Generally heat is more valuable when delivered at high temperature so to reduce thermal loss from PV-T collectors, the emissivity of the component solar cells can be adjusted.  This research has been applied to both raise the temperature of the collector in a PV-T module and reduce the temperature of a conventional (electrical only) module; the latter bringing the benefit of higher electrical power conversion efficiency and longer lifetime.",

Professor Glamore's research has shown that mangrove and estuary restoration can be undertaken successfully at scale. His work has resulted in the restoration of 1000’s of hectares of tidal wetlands and 100’s kms of estuaries. For decades his group was the only large group working on large-scale tidal wetland (now often called blue carbon) projects in Australia. To better understand the broader issues, Professor Glamore also leads major research programs on climate change in estuaries. His research has highlighted the need for strategic planning and the emerging role of nature-based markets. He is a vocal advocate for urgent and scalable solutions via incentivized markets.

By integrating advanced computational techniques with experimental neuroscience, Dr. Guo is committed to unraveling the complex mechanisms of neuromodulation and advancing innovative approaches in bionic device design. Guo pioneered the world-first simulation platform named \"virtual human retina\", for studying retinal degeneration and optimising stimulation strategies, providing enhanced artificial vision solutions. He uses computational models to guide his experimental investigations. In the last 10 years, Guo has gained extensive experience in recording electrophysiological signals from biological tissue, including the use of patch-clamping to record electrical activity in functionally-distinct retinal pathways.With this deep insight he has proposed a new stimulation scheme that allow different classes of retinal ganglion cells to be selectively excited. This has enormous potential in the design of visual prostheses as it will allow more realistic recreation of the visual scene – previously not possible with current state-of-the-art retinal neuroprostheses. The Virtual Eye and Retina platform is designed to simulate the performance of drug delivery systems, implantable and wearable neural stimulators, as well as non-electrical stimulation approaches such as optogenetic and ultrasound-based stimulation.",

A key focus of his recent research has been improving the fundamental understanding of hydrogen passivation mechanisms in silicon solar cells to overcome the negative impact of performance limiting defects, having developed advanced hydrogenation processes to improve the industrial solar cell efficiencies and reliability of PERC (achieved 24% efficiency with partner LONGi), TOPCon (24.6% with partner Jinko - now over 25%), and efficiency gains in the range of 0.4-0.7% absolute for industrial SHJ solar cells with a number of companies, with efficiencies as high as 24.5% (Hanergy). He is now focused on understanding and addressing material challenges for terawatt scale deployment of photovoltaics in the efforts towards net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes addressing critical material constraints for scarce elements such as silver for all industrial silicon solar cell technologies, indium and bismuth for heterojunction solar cells, and methods to reduce the consumption and environmental impact of using abundant materials at the cell, module and system level like aluminium, silicon, copper, steel, glass and concrete.

He has published more than 40 research papers and is a co-inventor on 5 patents. He is best known for his studies on the introduction and manipulation of hydrogen to passivate defects in silicon solar cells. His current research interests follow on from this work, with the primary focus being the modelling of hydrogen transport within silicon solar cell structures. In order to do this the parameters for hydrogen diffusion and interaction with common impurities are being investigated in detail. These fundamental studies link with a large number of other research projects within the University, including attempts to mitigate light-induced degradation and contact resistance issues in multicrystalline solar cells and the hydrogenation of solar cell geometries based on amorphous silicon or metal oxide passivation schemes.

Prof Rashidi’s research and teaching demonstrate how effectively transport engineering can draw upon the strengths of a broad range of disciplines to inform smart-city solutions. “Transport engineering does not work in isolation – economics, statistics, urban design and planning, infrastructure planning and operations, sustainability – they are all part of the matrix holding our cities together allowing for the ebb and flow of people and goods from point to point. They all need to be considered together.” Dr Rashidi enjoys this challenge of forward planning for the future of our cities using evidence-based analyses. “Our research has a lot to contribute to future proofing our cities. Our partnerships with government and industry are vital as they give us the ability to implement from classroom and laboratory to the real world, and position us at the forefront of technological innovation and emerging research themes.” Prof Rashidi is currently leading research into the interconnectivity between travel behaviour and time use and the potential of new mobility technologies to influence this paradigm. Prof Rashidi is also examining the capacity of social media data to complement existing data resources as part of the development of an integrated multi-level modelling framework to demonstrate the relationships between land use and transport systems and the consequences this has for city planning and travel behaviour more broadly.",

    "biography": "Associate Professor Jayantha Katupitiya is from the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. His research interests include: Autonomous Large Vehicle Guidance The research in this area is directed at automating large scale ground vehicles that operate on the agricultural fields and their autonomous navigation to conform to traversing specifications. They are, in general, articulated vehicle systems, in which a large tractor is providing propulsion and steering, and large implements are passively dragged behind. The control inputs to such a system are inadequate to guide the implements to follow a specified path. The research is aimed at providing the necessary control inputs at the implements to enable the precision autonomous navigation of the entire system. Research includes: i) the kinematic modelling of articulated systems taking into account the lateral and longitudinal wheels slips, ii) determination of force inputs using approximate dynamic models and the kinematic system responses, and iii) the design of controllers. Cooperative Control of Heterogeneous Autonomous Vehicles The research aims to achieve asynchronous cooperative control between one air vehicle and a fleet of ground vehicles. The goal is to navigate the ground vehicles to concurrently carry out a single task or to carry out a spatially distributed set of sub tasks that forms parts of a major task, under the supervision and coordination of the aerial vehicle. The fleet of ground vehicles are assumed to be distributed at different locations. In the case of a single task, the ground vehicles are assumed to have complementary capabilities. In the case of multiple tasks the ground vehicles may possess identical or complementary task execution capabilities. A practical scenario is bush fire containment. The research issues involve task identification and localisation through sensing carried out by the aerial vehicle, task scheduling, terrain mapping using the aerial vehicle, path planning for ground vehicles using terrain data and autonomous navigation of ground vehicles to their scheduled destinations. In particular, the research aims at developing a software architecture for the cooperative control of the group of vehicles and the development of methodologies for the direct navigation and control of ground vehicles under the continuous and direct command of aerial vehicles without the use of GPS data. Vectored Thrust Aerial Vehicles A Vectored Thrust Aerial Vehicle (VTAV) is similar to a VTOL aircraft yet it is meant for hover and near hover operation. The research platform is centred around an aircraft with three thrusters. Each thruster is realized using a torque cancelling ducted fan. One of the thrusters is fixed with respect to the VTAV body and the other two thrusters can be independently vectored around a common axis. The VTAV is a lot more stable platform than a helicopter and hence has a simpler dynamic model. In addition, the dynamic models of the hover and low speed cruise are almost identical and hence cruise to low speed flight transition is easier. The research consists of dynamic model building, experimental system identification, model validation and controller design to achieve low speed, zero-roll and zero-pitch flights so that the VTAV can be used for laser based terrain mapping. Force Controlled Ground Vehicles This research is motivated by the need to drive an off-road vehicle very accurately in an agricultural field to follow a predefined path. The research platform is a four wheel driven four wheel steered ground vehicle that has force sensors at each wheel measuring all forces and torques. The aim is to develop a comprehensive dynamic model and to validate its parameters through experimental system identification. The control task it to vector the four drive forces and the directions of the drive forces and the side slip forces (lateral forces) so that the actual trajectory of the instantaneous centre of rotation of the vehicle will follow a desired trajectory of the instantaneous centre of rotation with constant velocity.",

My research focuses on the fabrication of magnetic, electromagnetic and photo responsive nanomaterials that are driven by function. My goal is to bridge the gaps between fundamental research and applications of these advanced nanomaterials in areas of technological and broad societal interest. I was awarded a total of $3.99 millions in competitive research funding from the Australian Research Council to undertake research in novel material design and fabrication, and understanding of how these materials can be incorporated into new devices or engineering processes. To date, the materials my team designed have been used for cancer drug delivery, water treatment, and high performance electrochemical sensing. I also teach in the Chemical Engineering Program at UNSW's School of Chemical Engineering. As a Fellow of the UNSW Scientia Education Academy, a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy and the 2020 recipient of the Faculty of Engineering Education Innovation Fellow, I innovate and contribute to the design of engineering science, design and laboratory courses. My teaching philosophy aligns with a quote from Jacques-Yves Cousteau who said, “People protect what they love, they love what they understand, and they understand what they are taught” -- I see education as an act that transforms our beliefs, values and mindsets, with the potential to emancipate and empower its participants. My research has focused on the development of nanomaterials with tailored magnetic, photocatalytic, morphological and anti-microbial properties for biomedical and environmental applications. Underpinning the development of these advanced nanomaterials are studies on how their functions and performances are influenced by their physical, chemical and biological interactions with the system of interest.",

The vestibular organs, one in each inner ear, sense rotational and linear head motion and move the eyes to compensate for passive head movements. The vestibular organ can be damaged by disease, degenerative conditions and by chemical or surgical interventions. When both vestibular organs are damaged it can be severely debilitating. The research in this laboratory has two closely related goals: 1) to understand the signal processing mechanisms that control the VOR by analysing vestibular-evoked eye movements and single-unit (vestibular nerve) recordings; and 2) to apply this knowledge of basic vestibular physiology to the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders in humans.

Morrison has contributed to development projects in China, Indonesia and India including the design and development of solar thermal energy laboratories in Beijing, Wuhan and Kunming China. After retiring as Director of the Solar Thermal Energy Group at UNSW in 2005 Morrison co-founded Solar Heat & Power Pty Ltd (later Ausra Inc now Areva Solar) and developed the steam generation compact linear Fresnel solar concentrator installed at Liddell power station in the Hunter Valley NSW.  The same concept is now being used by Areva Solar for solar power station developments in Australia, USA, Europe and the Middle East. SPECIAL INTERESTS Primary research interest is the study of fluid flow and heat transfer processes, with particular interest in solar thermal energy processes.  A significant part of my research effort was directed towards the establishment and operation of the Solar Thermal Energy Research Laboratory at the University of New South Wales.  The measurement techniques developed in the laboratory have been adopted as Australian and International Standards.  The laboratory has been involved in a very active collaborative program with Industry and The University of Sydney Applied Physics School on the development of evacuated tubular solar collectors and high temperature solar steam generating systems.  The laboratory has also been involved in United Nations Development Program for projects in India and China and for training Engineers from Indonesia, India, Thailand and Eritrea, in the field of solar thermal systems. In addition to the laboratory based approach to the study of solar thermal energy processes Morrison has contributed to the development of internationally accepted computer simulation models for a wide range of solar and heat pump thermal systems.  The solar water heater code developed in the laboratory has been included in the TRNSYS modelling package, which is the most widely used simulation program for modelling solar thermal energy processes.  The code contributed to TRNSYS is the core model used of all solar thermosyphon water heater models.",

Professor Bing-Jie (Bruce) Ni received his PhD degree in environmental engineering in June 2009. He currently is an ARC Future Fellow and full professor at UNSW Sydney. He has been working in the field of environmental technology and wastewater treatment, particularly the interface among process engineering, microbial biotechnology, materials science and mathematical modeling, focusing on the integration of these disciplines to develop innovative and sustainable technological solutions to achieve high-levels of pollutant removal from wastewater with a minimised carbon footprint and maximised energy recovery, in order to transform wastes or wastewater from a troublesome pollutant to a valuable resource and save large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. Professor Ni is a worldwide pioneer in modeling and control of potent greenhouse gases (e.g., nitrous oxides and methane) emissions from wastewater management systems. He has made significant contributions to developing cost-effective biotechnologies/tools to lower methane and nitrous oxide, the two strong greenhouse gases directly generated in sewer management and wastewater treatment plant operations. Nitrous oxide, for example, has a 300 times stronger warming effect than carbon dioxide. Through his research, he has developed a new model to minimise and mitigate the quantity of GHG emissions from wastewater treatment. Particularly, he has developed a nitrous oxide emission model, which has been recently applied by IPCC (June 2019) to update its National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Guideline for the first time in 13 years (Prof Ni is the Lead Investigator). Based on his research, the IPCC guidelines significantly updated the default emission factors for nitrous oxide in one type of domestic wastewater treatment plant. The research has also contributed to the emissions factor tables and provides a more accurate accounting benchmark.",

This project aims to extend the density and coherence of qubits stored in superconducting-based quantum processors, by exploring the concept of hybrid quantum systems. Quantum computers are expected to impact a diverse range of sectors, from medicine to national security. This project seeks to develop an enabling technology, a memory, for scaling a quantum computer constructed from superconducting circuits, such as those being developed in commercial laboratories. Such scaling would improve the capacity of these processors to tackle complex problems. The quantum technology developed in this project will have immediate application in transforming a widely-used technique for studying the nanoscale structure of biomolecules - distance measurements in electron spin resonance spectroscopy.

After completing a Master of Science in Physics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (India) in 2008, he commenced his Doctor of Philosophy studies in the Department of Physics at the University of Auckland. His PhD research was supervised by Professor Roger Davies, and was supported by a Scholarship from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UniServices. Abhnil investigated the decadal fluctuations in tropical thin cirrus clouds after detection with an oblique stereo technique using the MISR instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite. Thin, high cirrus clouds warm the climate system due to their strong greenhouse effect and low albedo. These clouds are often missed by nadir-viewing satellites due to low contrast in the images. However, they are widespread features of the tropical atmosphere at altitudes of 12–14 km. Abhnil used the oblique cameras on MISR to improve detection of thin cirrus clouds in the tropics. The additional cirrus detected by MISR was useful in understanding its climatology and distribution in the tropics. Current trends suggest a consistent reduction in cirrus cloud heights allowing the earth to cool more efficiently. This result agreed with trends of thick cloud heights from MISR. His results showed the net effect of thin and thick clouds may potentially slow the rate of global warming if the current trends continue into subsequent decades. During his doctoral studies Abhnil developed a strong interest in satellite remote sensing of clouds. He is currently employed as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of New South Wales, developing algorithms for detecting cloud motion vectors using geostationary satellites to improve short-term solar irradiance forecasts in Australia. Later he joined the Physical Meteorology and Atmospheric Climate Dynamics Group led by Prof. Steven Sherwood at the Climate Change Research Centre. Currently, he investigates triggering of convection in the tropics using models and observations. UNSW Sydney NSW 2052 Australia Telephone: +61 2 93851000",

    "biography": "Stuart's principal research interest is in developing understanding of the relationships between the structures adopted by molecules at interfaces and the physical properties of these interfaces. Of particular interest have been polymers at the solid-liquid interface of nanoparticles dispersed in water. Such particles have high surface areas to be used for further chemistry, can have useful electronic properties for energy applications and are widely used from personal care formulations through to drug delivery vehicles. The potential economic and environmental impacts of improving our understanding of particulate dispersions are quite high. Stuart's approach to understanding molecules at surfaces is to bring together various analytical techniques with numerical simulations to help gain the most from the available experimental data. He has extensively used solvent relaxation NMR as a way of characterising near-surface polymer/surfactant complexes has been a workhorse technique for my research in recent years. Through solvent relaxation NMR, in concert with light scattering and small-angle neutron scattering, he demonstrated antagonistic interactions exist between commonly used polymers and surfactants that leads to the destabilisation of nanoparticle dispersions. He also has a long-standing collaboration with US start-up company XiGo Nanotools to design and build bespoke, miniaturised hardware for solvent relaxation NMR and to develop suitable software for controlling the instrument and analysing the data. The instrument is commercially available as the “Acorn Area” with the “AreaQuant” software for measuring the surface area of colloidal dispersions. Stuart also uses neutron scattering and neutron reflection to obtain detailed structural information on soft-condensed matter systems. He worked on the design, construction and commissioning of a new sample environment for neutron reflection experiments to study the effects of confinement on near-surface structures. Collisions between colloidal particles are one form of confinement, as is lubrication between surfaces. He recently published the designs for the cell along with studies of polyelectrolyte multilayers .",

    "biography": "Chris Rizos is an Emeritus Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and a co-director of the Satellite Navigation and Positioning (SNAP) Lab at UNSW. My early fascination with old maps and Australia’s exploring pioneers sparked my own exploration of what we know today as the global navigation satellite technologies of the future. The bulk of my research is therefore in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and their applications, which extend across the whole spectrum of uses from Navigation to Geodesy. With over 20 years of service to some of the most prominent international geodetic organisations, I have had the opportunity to be part of the evolution of a field that has considerable global impact. As a big picture thinker I have watched Geodesy rapidly evolve with its tools and datasets helping geoscientists monitor global change (including natural and climate change), changes in the environment (to ice sheets and atmosphere) and geohazards (volcanos and earthquakes), and surveyors and engineers applying these technologies from small-scale building works to international mapping projects. Through my research, my aim has been to “spatially enable” all aspects of life, through the further development of technologies and systems that provide continuous, seamless, high accuracy positioning of objects, people and every feature on the surface of the Earth.

I have a strong interest in sonification - the non-auditory representation of sonic artefacts. We might be is motivated by the following concern...what do non-representational gestures in sonic explorations, in sound art, mean ? I do not mean this in a vernacular \"what does sound art mean for us?\" kind of a way, but rather something more concrete. In much the same way that we have theories of meaning for natural languages built upon truth-conditional semantics (for just one example), I would like us to have a theory of meaning for sonic gestures encompassing timbre and texture. The trick I think, is to specify a proper notion of success conditions for the interpretation of sonic gestures, where these conditions in no way turn on latent representations at any stage.

He has a wide experience in designing, developing and modelling complex multiphysics system including food processing, ultrasonic processing, heat and mass transfer, multiphase hydrodynamic systems, transport of light and radiation, membranes,  photocatalysis, chemical reactions, and water detoxification. In the field of ultrasonics Dr Trujillo has worked on modelling ultrasonic operations of importance for the food processing industry such as modelling the acoustic streaming generated by low-frequency-high-power horn sonoreactors.  Currently Dr Trujillo is working on achieving separation of particles and liquid droplets within emulsions via high frequency ultrasound, which can find several applications of importance for food, biological, pharmaceutical, chemical and petrochemical industries. In the area of water detoxification Dr Trujillo is currently working on Radio Frequency (RF) Plasma on water for destruction of microorganisms and chemical pollutants.  Using RF alone and/or combined with ultrasound or electrolysis is a new process for complete mineralization of recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater. In the case of Ultrasonic Assisted Plasma Detoxification (UAPD) ultrasound is injected into the fluid via a horn producing cavitation bubbles, while plasma is produced via Radio Frequency electromagnetic waves.  The mechanism of this technology is still unknown but is based on the synergism of acoustic cavitation bubbles that facilitate and sustain the plasma formation. The plasma produces radical species that mineralize pollutants and inactivate microorganisms. Dr Trujillo is also working in using RF electric fields as a non-thermal processing technology for inactivation of vegetative microorganisms in foods by rupturing cellular membranes at sub-pasteurization temperatures. This is a promising technology for the preservation of heat sensitive food products as well as liquid foods with enhanced organoleptic properties due to lower temperature and treatment times.",

I am currently an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My research ranges from theory (intelligent agents, data mining, agent-based modelling), to practice (dialogue management, personal assistants, recommender systems, computational social science). Since joining UNSW in 2002, I have collaborated extensively with industry, serving for over 10 years as Programme Manager and Project Leader in three CRCs (Smart Internet Technology CRC, Smart Services CRC and Data to Decisions CRC). A highlight of Smart Internet Technology CRC was the development of a voice controlled mobile application for interaction with e-mail and calendar (a precursor to Apple's Siri). A major achievement through Smart Services CRC was the deployment of a people-to-people recommender system for suggesting suitable matches in online dating, fielded on one of Australia's largest online dating sites. In Data to Decisions CRC, I led a multi-disciplinary team of data scientists and social scientists, researching efficient methods for extracting information from high velocity streams of rich text data (such as social media and news feeds), and developing new methods for opinion mining and sentiment analysis for political tweets and Facebook posts.",
