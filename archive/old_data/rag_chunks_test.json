He received his BE in Electrical Engineering from UNSW in 1997 and his PhD from UTS in 2002. His PhD research was on the estimation of frequency for the frequency tracking for communications with a low earth orbit satellite. From 2003 to 2007 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Digital Communications at the University of Edinburgh, where he conducted research on space-time adaptive processing for radar target detection. From 2007 to 2018 he was a senior lecturer at UNSW and associate professor from 2019 until 2022. His research interests include: Dr Aboutanios is currently conducting research in the areas of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , global navigation satellite systems (such as GPS), radar target detection , biologically inspired signal processing , power systems and smart grids , and theoretical signal processing . He is also active in the research of teaching methodologies and course design. In particular, Dr Aboutanios has developed a new course on electrical engineering design and has established the masters program in satellite systems engineering. He also has an active interest in satellite technology and in particular cubesats. He set up UNSW's involvement in the European QB50 project and led the UNSW-EC0 project that resulted in the launch of the satellite in 2017. Dr Aboutanios is a member of the Space Industry Association of Australia's Legislation Working Group. He has made multiple submissions to the Australian Government's review of the Space Activities Act.
